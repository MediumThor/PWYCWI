To implement the functionality you've described, where a new member is added to the Firestore collection and then an authenticated user is created based on that new member's data (email, lastName, memberId), followed by sending a welcome email, your setup seems mostly correct. I'll outline the process and provide some guidance on ensuring it works as intended.

Firestore Trigger and Auth User Creation
Your Cloud Function createAuthUserForMember listens for new documents added to the members collection. Upon a new member document creation, it reads the member's data, generates a password, creates an authenticated user, and updates the member document with the new user's UID. This part is well-implemented.

Sending Welcome Email
The sendWelcomeEmail function is triggered when a new authenticated user is created. It sends a welcome email to the new user's email address. Ensure you have configured your email sending service (mailTransport) correctly, and replace ${APP_NAME} with your actual app name.

Frontend Trigger
The frontend part, where you add a new member using the MemberAdditionModal, seems to be set up correctly. When you submit the form in your modal:

You generate a unique memberId.
You prepare the member data and add it to the members collection using Firestore.
Upon successful addition, Firestore's onCreate trigger for the members collection is fired, leading to the execution of your Cloud Function createAuthUserForMember.
This function creates an authenticated user and updates the member document with the new user's UID.
The creation of an authenticated user then triggers the sendWelcomeEmail function, sending the welcome email.
Potential Enhancements and Considerations
Email Sending Service: Ensure that your mailTransport service is correctly configured to send emails. If you're using a service like SendGrid, Nodemailer, or any other, ensure it's initialized and authenticated properly in your Cloud Functions environment.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling, especially for email sending and user creation parts, to handle cases like email sending failures or user creation issues.
Security Rules: Your Firestore security rules seem to be set up to allow the required operations. Make sure that the rules align with your app's security requirements. The rules you've posted allow for a fairly broad range of read/write operations, so make sure that's what you intend.
Testing: Thoroughly test the whole flow in a safe testing environment to ensure everything works as expected before deploying it to production.
If everything is set up correctly, adding a new member through your frontend should trigger the Firestore onCreate event, leading to the creation of an authenticated user and the sending of a welcome email.

createAuthUserForMember: This function triggers when a new document is added to the members collection in Firestore. It creates a new Firebase Authentication user with the provided email and a generated password. It then sets custom claims based on the membershipType field in the Firestore document. These custom claims can be used for access control in your app. After setting up the user and custom claims, it updates the Firestore document with the user's UID and sends a welcome email with login details.

handleMemberRoleChange: This function triggers when a document in the members collection is updated. It checks if the role or membershipType fields have changed and updates the Firebase Authentication custom claims accordingly. This ensures that changes in user roles or membership types are reflected in the user's Authentication profile, which can be critical for access control within your app.
